# Recursion

![Day 8 Code]()
*Exploring the concept of recursion in C today!*

## Objective:
Understand the principles of recursion and how to implement recursive functions effectively.

## Tasks:

### Recursion Basics:
  * Learn the definition and characteristics of recursive functions.
  * Understand the importance of base cases in preventing infinite recursion.

### Write a C Program Using Recursion:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Implements a recursive function to calculate factorial.
    - Demonstrates other examples of recursion, such as Fibonacci sequence calculation or solving the Towers of Hanoi problem.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to explore different recursive algorithms.
  * Challenge with optimizing recursive functions using memoization.

### Reflect:
  * Write a blog post reflection on the concepts and challenges faced today.
