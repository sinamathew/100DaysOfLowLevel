# Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc, free)

![Day 11 Code]()
*Learning about dynamic memory allocation in C today!*

## Objective:
Understand dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()` and `free()` functions.

## Tasks:

### Dynamic Memory Basics:
  * Explore how dynamic memory allocation works in C.
  
### Write a C Program Using Dynamic Memory Allocation:
  * Create a program that:
    - Allocates memory for an array or structure dynamically.
    - Uses `malloc()` for allocation and `free()` for deallocation.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to handle memory reallocation with `realloc()`.
  
### Reflect:
  * Write a blog post reflection on dynamic memory management techniques learned today.
