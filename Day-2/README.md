# Control Structures and Funtions
![Day 2 Code](https://imgur.com/qibU7Sk.jpg)
*Continuing my journey with control structures and funtions in C!*

## Objective:
Familiarize with control structures (if, else, while) and function in C programming.

## Tasks:

### Read and Understand Control Structures:
  * Review the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making.
  * Learn how to implement loops using `while` and `for` statements.

### Explore Functions:
  * Understand the structure of a function, including return types, parameters, and function prototypes.
  * Write simple functions to perform specific tasks.

### Write a Simple C Program:
  * Create a custom `putchar` function with `write`.
  * Create a C program that:
    - Uses `putchar()` to print characters instead of `printf()` or `puts()`.
    - Implements control structures to create a simple number guessing game.
    - Uses ASCII values to display characters based on user input.

### Experiment with ASCII:
  * Create a program that:
    - Asks the user for a character input.
    - Displays the ASCII value of the entered character using `putchar()`.

### Reflect:
  * Wrote a blog post reflection on what I learned today and any challenges I faced.

## Resources:

  - The C Programming Language - Dennis & Brian - 2nd Edition

## Goal:
By the end of the day, I have a solid understanding of control structures, functions, and how to use `putchar()` effectively. Happy logic!
