# More Dynamic Memory Allocation

![Day 12 Code]()
*Continuing with dynamic memory allocation techniques in C today!*

## Objective:
Further explore advanced dynamic memory management techniques.

## Tasks:

### Advanced Memory Management Concepts:
  * Learn about memory leaks and how to avoid them.
  
### Write a C Program Using Advanced Dynamic Memory Techniques:
  * Create a program that manages multiple dynamic arrays or structures.
  
### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to implement error handling for memory allocation failures.
  
### Reflect:
  * Write a blog post reflection on advanced dynamic memory management strategies learned today.

## Resources:
