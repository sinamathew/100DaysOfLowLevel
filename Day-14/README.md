# Structures and Typedef

![Day 14 Code]()
*Studying structures and typedefs in C today!*

## Objective:
Learn about structures and typedefs for organizing complex data types.

## Tasks:

### Structures Basics:
   * Understand what structures are and how they are defined.
   
### Using Typedef with Structures: 
   * Explore how to create type definitions for structures using `typedef`.
   
### Write a C Program Using Structures and Typedefs: 
   * Create a program that defines structures for complex data types (e.g., student records).
   
### Experiment: 
   * Modify the program to include nested structures or arrays within structures.
   
### Reflect: 
   * Write a blog post reflection on structures, typedefs, and their applications learned today.
