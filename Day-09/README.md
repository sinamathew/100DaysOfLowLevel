# Static Libraries

![Day 9 Code]()
*Delving into static libraries in C today!*

## Objective:
Learn about static libraries, their creation, and usage in C programming.

## Tasks:

### Understanding Static Libraries:
  * Explore what static libraries are and how they differ from dynamic libraries.
  * Learn about the benefits of using static libraries in projects.

### Create a Static Library:
  * Write a set of functions and compile them into a static library.
  * Create a sample program that links against this library.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the library by adding new functions and recompile it.
  * Explore how to manage multiple static libraries in a project.

### Reflect:
  * Write a blog post reflection on the process and insights gained today.
