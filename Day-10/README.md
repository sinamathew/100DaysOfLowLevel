# Command-Line Arguments (argc, argv)

![Day 10 Code]()
*Exploring command-line arguments in C today!*

## Objective:
Understand how to handle command-line arguments in C programs using `argc` and `argv`.

## Tasks:

### Command-Line Arguments Basics:
  * Learn what command-line arguments are and how they are passed to programs.
  
### Write a C Program Using Command-Line Arguments:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Accepts user input through command-line arguments.
    - Processes and displays the arguments appropriately.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to handle different data types from command-line inputs.
  
### Reflect:
  * Write a blog post reflection on handling command-line arguments and any challenges faced.
