# Day 5: Pointers and Arrays

Day 5 Code
*Learning about pointers and arrays in C today!*

## Objective:
Understand the concepts of pointers and arrays, and how to use them effectively in C programming.

## Tasks:

### Pointers:
  * Learn what pointers are and how they work in C.
  * Understand pointer arithmetic and how to manipulate pointers.
  * Practice declaring and initializing pointers.

### Arrays:
  * Learn about arrays and how to declare and initialize them.
  * Understand array indexing and how to access array elements.
  * Practice using arrays with pointers.

### Write a C Program Using Pointers and Arrays:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Demonstrates the use of pointers to access and modify array elements.
    - Performs operations on arrays using pointers (e.g., searching, sorting).
    - Showcases the integration of pointers and arrays in solving problems.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to include more advanced pointer and array operations.
  * Challenge by creating unique applications that leverage pointers and arrays.

### Reflect:
  * Wrote a blog post reflection on lesson learnt and any challenges faced.
