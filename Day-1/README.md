# Syntax, Data Types and Variables
![Day 1 Code](https://imgur.com/0NuX1U8.jpg)
*Getting startted with C syntax, data types and varibles. As always `Hello, World!` comes first.*

## Objective:
Familiarize with the fundamental concepts of C programming, including syntax, data types, and variable declaration.

## Tasks:

### Read and Understand Basic C Syntax:
  * Review the structure of a C program, including the `#include` directive, `main()` function, and return statement.
  * Understand how to write comments in C (single-line and multi-line).

### Explore Data Types:
  * Learn about the basic data types in C:
    - `int` (integer)
    - `float` (floating-point)
    - `double` (double precision floating-point)
    - `char` (character)
  * Understand the concept of type modifiers (e.g., `short`, `long`, `signed`, `unsigned`).
 
### Declare and Initialize Variables:
  * Practice declaring variables of different data types.
  * Initialize variables with values and understand the importance of initialization.

### Write a Simple C Program:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Declares variables of different data types.
    - Initializes them with values.
    - Prints the values to the console and standard error using `printf()`, `puts()` and `putchar()`.
    - Get the size of data types with `sizeof()`

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to add more variables and print their values.
  * Try using different data types and observe how they behave.

### Reflect:
  * Wrote a blog post reflection on what I learned today and any challenges I faced.

## Goal:
By the end of the day, I have solid understanding of basic C syntax, data types, and how to declare and initialize variables. Happy logic!
