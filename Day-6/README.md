# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

![Day 6 Code](https://imgur.com/Qqhm6TO.jpg)
*Diving deeper into pointers, arrays, and strings in C today!*

## Objective:
Explore more advanced concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

## Tasks:

### Pointers and Arrays:
  * Practice using pointers to manipulate arrays in more complex scenarios.
  * Understand dynamic memory allocation using `malloc()` and `free()`.

### Strings:
  * Learn about strings and how they are represented in C using character arrays.
  * Explore string manipulation functions from the standard library (e.g., `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcat()`).
  * Practice writing custom string manipulation functions using pointers and arrays.

### Write a C Program Combining Pointers, Arrays, and Strings:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Demonstrates the use of pointers and arrays to manipulate strings.
    - Implements custom string manipulation functions.
    - Showcases the integration of pointers, arrays, and strings in solving problems.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to include more advanced string manipulation techniques.
  * Challenge by creating unique applications that leverage pointers, arrays, and strings.

### Reflect:
  * Wrote a blog post reflection on lesson learnt and any challenges faced.
