# Day 7: More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Day 7 Code
*Continuing to explore pointers, arrays, and strings in C today!*

## Objective:
Further expand knowledge on pointers, arrays, and strings, focusing on more advanced techniques and applications.

## Tasks:

### Pointers and Arrays:
  * Practice using pointers to manipulate multi-dimensional arrays.
  * Explore the concept of pointer arrays (arrays of pointers) and their use cases.

### Strings:
  * Learn about string tokenization using `strtok()` function.
  * Practice implementing string comparison and sorting algorithms using pointers and arrays.

### Write a C Program Combining Advanced Pointer and String Techniques:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Demonstrates the use of pointers to manipulate multi-dimensional arrays and pointer arrays.
    - Implements string tokenization and sorting algorithms using pointers and arrays.
    - Showcases the integration of advanced pointer and string techniques in solving complex problems.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to include more advanced pointer and string manipulation techniques.
  * Challenge yourself by creating unique applications that leverage pointers, arrays, and strings in innovative ways.

### Reflect:
  * Write a blog post reflection on what I learned today and any challenges I faced.
