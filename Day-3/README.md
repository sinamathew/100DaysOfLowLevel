# Day 3: Functions and Nested Loops

![Day 3 Code](https://imgur.com/u7a2sPE.jpg)
_Exploring functions and nested loops in C today!_

## Objective:

Dive deeper into functions and nested loops, understanding their structure and applications.

## Tasks:

### Functions:

- Practice writing functions with different return types and parameters.
- Understand function scope and how to use local and global variables effectively.

### Nested Loops:

- Learn how to create loops within loops (nested loops).
- Explore various use cases for nested loops, such as printing patterns.

### Write a C Program with Functions and Nested Loops:

- Create a C program that:
  - Defines functions to perform specific tasks.
  - Uses nested loops to generate patterns or perform complex operations.
  - Demonstrates the integration of functions and nested loops.

### Experiment:

- Modify the program to include more functions and nested loops.
- Challenge by creating more complex patterns or algorithms.

### Reflect:

- Wrote a blog post reflection on what learnt today and any challenges faced.

## Resources:

- Low-Level Programming - Igor Zhirkov - Â© 2017
- The C Programming Language - Dennis & Brian - 2nd Edition

## Goal:

By the end of the day, will have a deeper understanding of functions and nested loops, and how to effectively use them in C programming. Happy logic!
