# More Functions and Nested Loops

Day 4 Code
*Practicing more functions and nested loops in C today!*

## Objective:
Continue practicing functions and nested loops, exploring more advanced use cases and techniques.

## Tasks:

### Functions:
  * Write functions that call other functions (function composition).
  * Explore the concept of function pointers and how to use them.

### Nested Loops:
  * Practice creating more complex nested loops for various patterns and algorithms.
  * Understand the importance of loop optimization and how to avoid common pitfalls.

### Write a C Program with Advanced Functions and Nested Loops:
  * Create a C program that:
    - Demonstrates the use of function composition and function pointers.
    - Generates complex patterns or solves algorithmic problems using nested loops.
    - Showcases the integration of advanced function techniques and nested loops.

### Experiment:
  * Modify the program to include more advanced function usages and nested loop patterns.
  * Challenge by creating unique and visually appealing patterns or solving complex problems.

### Reflect:
  * Wrote a blog post reflection on lessons learnt today and any challenges faced.
